This repository contains the code for the paper:
- [Rapid design of fully soft deployable structures via kirigami cuts and active learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.11546)

Here, we propose a rapid design approach for fully soft structures that can achieve targeted 3D shapes through a fabrication process that happens entirely on a 2D plane. We develop a symmetry constrained active learning approach to learn how to explore the large design space efficiently. The proposed framework can accelerate adoption of morphing structures in a range of areas including soft robotics, additive manufacturing, and construction industry.

## Requirements
To run the code, you must install the following dependencies first:
- PyTorch (1.8.1)
- [atomai](https://github.com/pycroscopy/atomai)
- [scikit-optimize](https://scikit-optimize.github.io/stable/)

You also need to install the FEA software:
- PyTorch (1.8.1)

## Files
- `cnntrain_vae.py` performs variational autoencoder to reduce the dimension of candidate kirigami patterns to low dimension representations
- `cnntrainv2_baysesskit.py` performs Bayesian optimization. The python code runs the Matlab files and ABAQUS during each round of iteration. The code also 
- Matlab files are used to create the mesh, boundary conditions input to the ABAQUS simulation
- 'readodb.py' reads the odb files generated by ABAQUS.
